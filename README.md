# ArcGIS REST API Reader

## Why?
ArcGIS REST services often come with a limitation of 1000 features on their response. This value, set by default by Esri, can be modified by data publishers. However, we don't always have contact with them or, by any reason, increasing the limit is not convenient.

This tool tries to avoid this limitation for data consumers.
